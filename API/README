Riot Games API is rate-limited and needs an authorized API key to access the limited endpoints. This inelegant code allows requests to be cached to a database, avoiding rate-limiting blocks without exposing the API key.

I am publishing this API source code for transparency reasons only and don't guarantee that it will work in case you want to deploy it yourself.
In case you do, though, you need to include the following environment variables:
"riot_api_key", "DB_CONNECT"

Riot Games API key can be obtained here (need to request full access key to increase rate-limiting):
https://developer.riotgames.com/

"DB_CONNECT" is your MongoDB connection string.
